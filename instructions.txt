                                        -MEMORY CARD GAME-

---How does it work ?----
(1) Initialize the game by enter number of players, their names and number of cards (max 20)
(2) In the UI, different componets are displayed:
    - Current player's name(label) and point(LCDnumber) on the left
    - Correct cards chosen by current player in the middle
    - Feedback on the previous play on the right
    - Grid layout to contain all the cards (both active and deactivated)
    - Two buttons: Confirm (to end the turn) and Give up (to end the game and show the winner)
(3) To play:
    - Wait till your name displayed under the label "Current player".
    - Choose 2 cards by clicking on them. Once a card was chosen, you can not click it again to toggle
,i.e turn its face down. You can only proceed by Confirm (so the program can check your choice) or Give up
and let the program tell you who is the winner.
    - The turn is your as long as your previous choice was correct. The correct pairs of your will be displayed
below the label "Correct pairs". The feedback on the right is of the latest choosing. Your point will also be updated.
(4) If you have turned all the cards or chose to "Give up", there will be a message box with the conclusion and
Ok button in it. Click the Okay button when you knew who won, the program will close right after that.
